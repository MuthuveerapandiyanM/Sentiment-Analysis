## Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing

### Sentiment Analysis Model which takes in a huge corpus of data having user reviews and finds a pattern and comes up with a conclusion based on real evidence rather than assumptions made on a small sample of data.

### We can even break these principal sentiments(positive and negative) into smaller sub sentiments such as “Happy”, “Love”, ”Surprise”, “Sad”, “Fear”, “Angry” etc. as per the needs or business requirement.

Basic Python Libraries

1. Pandas – library for data analysis and data manipulation
2. Matplotlib – library used for data visualization
3. Seaborn – a library based on matplotlib and it provides a high-level interface for data visualization
4. WordCloud – library to visualize text data
5. re – provides functions to pre-process the strings as per the given regular expression

Natural Language Processing

1. nltk – Natural Language Toolkit is a collection of libraries for natural language processing

2. stopwords – a collection of words that don’t provide any meaning to a sentence

3. WordNetLemmatizer – used to convert different forms of words into a single item but still keeping the context intact.

4. CountVectorizer – transform text to vectors

5. GridSearchCV – for hyperparameter tuning

6. RandomForestClassifier – machine learning algorithm for classification

Evaluation Metrics

1. Accuracy Score – no. of correctly classified instances/total no. of instances

2. Precision Score – the ratio of correctly predicted instances over total positive instances

3. Recall Score – the ratio of correctly predicted instances over total instances in that class

4. Roc Curve – a plot of true positive rate against false positive rate

5. Classification Report – report of precision, recall and f1 score

6. Confusion Matrix – a table used to describe the classification models
